- drupal **site:new**
	Builds a new site using Drupal project as template https://github.com/dennisinteractive/drupal-project

- drupal **site:checkout** *site-name* [--branch|--tag]
	Performs a git clone and checks out the specified branch or tag

- drupal **site:checkout:tag** *site-name* --tag

- drupal **site:settings** *site-name*
    - Runs `site:settings:db`
    - Runs `site:settings:memcache`
    - Creates *settings.php* using *default.settings.php* provided by Drupal core, then appends includes for the settings below:
      - *settings.db.php* Database credentials.
      - *settings.memcache.php* Memcache configuration.
	  - *settings.local.php* in the *web/sites/[site name]* directory. This file is auto-generated and should not be committed. If you have a file named `web/sites/example.settings.local.php` on the site's folder, it will be used as a template for settings.local.php.
	  - *settings.[env].php* These files are auto-generated and should not be committed. Depending on your environment (--env option), it will copy the respective file into *web/sites/[site name]*. i.e. default.settings.dev.php -> settings.dev.php
	  - *settings.mine.php* Use this file to add your personal customisations to override all of the above.

  **It is recommended to add settings.*.php to .gitignore.**

- drupal **site:settings:db** *site-name*
	Creates *settings.db.php* in the *web/sites/default* folder. This file contains DB credentials and should not be committed.

- drupal **site:settings:memcache** *site-name*
	Creates *settings.memcache.php* in the *web/sites/default* folder. This file contains Memcache configuration and should not be committed.

- drupal **site:phpunit:setup** *site-name*

- drupal **site:behat:setup** *site-name*
	Creates *behat.yml* in the *tests* folder. This file contains Behat configuration and should not be committed.

- drupal **site:db:import** *site-name*
	If a database dump is available, it will drop the current database and import the dump. The db-dump information comes from *~/.console/sites/site-name.yml*.
	The command will copy the dump from the original place to */tmp*. If you run the command again, it will only copy the file once the original has changed. This is very useful when working remotely on slow networks.
	If no db-dump information is available or there is no dump at the location, it will run a site install.
	Supported extensions: **.sql**, **.sql.gz**.

- drupal **site:update** *site-name*
  Used to run updates, import configuration, clear caches
  You can enable/disable modules after import by adding the list to the site.yml file. i.e.
  ```
    modules:
      enable:
        - stage_file_proxy
        - devel
      disable:
        - cdn
  ```
